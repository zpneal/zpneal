👋 Hi, I’m @zpneal. You can find out more about me at [www.zacharyneal.com](https://www.zacharyneal.com), but briefly...
- 👀 I’m interested in using R for Network Science.
- 🧑‍💻 I'm mainly working on developing the [`backbone`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=backbone) package for extracting network backbones, the [`incidentally`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=incidentally) for generating and manipulating incidence matrices and bipartite graphs, and the [`grand`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=grand) package that implements **G**uidelines for **R**eporting **A**bout **N**etwork **D**ata.
- 🆕 I've just started working on the [`childfree`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=childfree) package for accessing and harmonizing childfree demographic data.
