- 👋 Hi, I’m @zpneal. You can find out more about me at [www.zacharyneal.com](https://www.zacharyneal.com), but briefly...
- 👀 I’m interested in using R for Network Science.
- 🧑‍💻 I'm mainly working on developing the [`backbone`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=backbone) package for extracting network backbones, and the [`incidentally`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=incidentally) for generating and manipulating incidence matrices and bipartite graphs.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at zpneal@msu.edu, on Twitter (for now) at [@zpneal](https://twitter.com/zpneal), and on Mastodon at [@zpneal@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@zpneal)
